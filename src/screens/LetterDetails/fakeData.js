this is a reminder that you are doing a really great job.

you are. you're nourishing a little one and that is no easy feat, no matter what the journey looks like. 

you are showing up, sharing your heart (and your milk), giving your all and getting through. 

you are beautiful. you are capable. and you are not alone.

just keep going...
